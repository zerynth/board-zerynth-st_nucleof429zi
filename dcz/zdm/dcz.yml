# Zerynth Device Configuration
#
# this file declares a set of resources to be loaded on the device
# in a way that is indipendent from the firmware in order to facilitate
# mass programming and mass provisioning.
#
# It is in Yaml format, and the various sections/options are documented below


# this field must be true to enable this configuration!
# if not present or false, the configuration is skipped
active: true

# Provisioning Section
#
# in the "provisioning" section, the various resources
# with their location and their generation method are listed
#
# For each resource the following fields are mandatory:
#
# - name: an ascii string specifying the resource name (max 16 bytes)
# - type: the type of the resource [file, prvkey, pubkey, cert]
# - args: a list of arguments needed to load or generate the resource
# - mapping: a list of addresses where the resource must be copied
# 
# When using DCZ (see next section), an optional parameter "format" can be given.
# It must be an ascii string of at most 4 bytes, by default it is set to "bin"
#
# uncomment the following section to enable provisioning
provisioning:
    # the provisioning method for the ZDM
    method: zdm
    # the list of resources
    resources:
        - name: zdeviceinfo
          type: file
          args: zdevice.json
          mapping: [0x8104000]
          format: json



############################
# DCZ Section
#
# in the "dcz" section the provisioned resources (or a subset of them)
# can be included in the Device Configuration Zone. The DCZ is a versionable index
# of the available resources that can be easily accessed and updated 
# with the dcz Zerynth module.
#
# DCZ supports up to 8 replication zones for safety. If a resource is included in a DCZ
# with replication n, it must be placed in exactly n different locations for versioning
#
# uncomment the section below to enable dcz
dcz:
    # locations of the DCZs (replication 1)
    mapping: [0x8100000]
    # list of resource names to be included
    resources:
